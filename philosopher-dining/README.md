## Dining Philosophers
Suppose such a scenario: 5 plates of spaghetti, 5 forks, and 5 hungry philosophers. The problem is that each philosopher needs to use 2 forks to eat his supper.
The problem here is contention for limited resources. The danger is dead-lock. Other concerns are starvation, and avoiding excessive overhead when there isn't contention.
